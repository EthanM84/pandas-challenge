		<h1>Schools Performance And Budget Analysis</h1>
	</header>
	<main>
<!-- 		<h2>Metrics</h2>
		<p>The analysis shows the performance of different schools in terms of various metrics:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Total students</li>
			<li>Budget</li>
			<li>Average math and reading scores</li>
			<li>Passing rates</li> -->
		</ul>
		<p>The analysis shows the performance of different schools in terms of various metrics such as total students, budget, average math and reading scores, and passing rates. The schools are categorized into two types: district and charter.</p>
		<h2>Conclusions</h2>
		<p>Two conclusions from the calculations are:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Charter schools generally have better academic performance compared to district schools. The average math and reading scores, as well as the passing rates for both subjects and overall, are higher for charter schools compared to district schools.</li>
			<li>School budget and per student budget do not necessarily correlate with academic performance. Some schools with lower budgets and per student budgets perform better than schools with higher budgets and per student budgets. For instance, Holden High School, which has the lowest total school budget and per student budget among all schools in the analysis, has higher passing rates for math, reading, and overall compared to several other schools with higher budgets.</li>
